I am a data engineer with a background in statistics and data science.
I have produced insightful reports as a data analyst in a variety of projects and am now the lead data engineer for an interactive data-dashboard.

### Employment

- July 2019 to Present: Strategic Consultant (Data Science and Data Engineering), Amey Strategic Consulting (London, UK)
  - I am part of a team working with a local government to create a web-dashboard that incorporates many data-sources.
    I created the data ingestion pipeline to load data from IoT devices, online APIs and daily reports into a central database.
    I then built the graphs and maps which gave the client insight into their efficiency and automated some previously manual processes.
    I also administrate the platform's deployment on AWS using Docker and recently set up the CI pipeline, allowing the entire team to use our time more effectively.
    Throughout the project I have communicated intuitively as I continually present my findings to clients and internal stakeholders in an easily digestible way.
    Recently, I worked with a stakeholder to identify an inefficiency in their work allocation and am developing a predictive machine learning model to enable data-driven planning.
    My personal highlight was designing and building a proof of concept application to manage and collect data from a network of IoT sensors which will allow for real-time monitoring of drainage assets.
  - I collaborated with Amey's HR department to complete an analysis of the gender pay gap of thousands of employees across all departments in the company.
    The visualisations, statistics and forecasts I produced using R guided the company's decision making with regards to gender equality in pay rates.
    I then created a Python package to automatically perform these forecasts and trained an HR analyst with no prior Python knowledge to produce original analyses.
  - I completed a focused two week analytics sprint on the contract fulfilled by Amey for a local council.
    I collected user-stories and datasets from both the Amey and client teams about the processes used and delivered a presentation of data visualisations, highlighting key successes and opportunities.
  - I am a maintainer of the team's financial platform, an R Shiny dashboard that allows team members and project managers to monitor expenditure, register risks and keep track of invoices while synchronising the data with a relational database.
- June 2018 to September 2018: Data Science Services Intern, Asia Analytics Taiwan (Taipei, Taiwan)
  - In my internship I created extensions for data cleansing and data mining in SPSS and SPSS Modeller using Python and R.
    I added features quickly when requested, made an intuitive but powerful interface for the extensions and documented the process used.
    I also wrote an in-depth tutorial on programming using SPSS Syntax from scratch, demonstrating my ability to learn and clearly communicate concepts to an audience who were unfamiliar with the topic.

### Education

- 2015 to 2019: MMath Mathematics, 2:1 (University of Exeter, UK)
  - My Masters' dissertation involved combining modern neural networks using Keras with more traditional regression and Gaussian processes models with the aim of providing more human-understandable insights to machine learning algorithms.
    I successfully modelled a neural network using multiple techniques in a way that simplified the complex internal system to well-understood statistical processes.
  - Other modules included statistical modelling using R, machine learning using Python and spatio-temporal statistics.
- 2009 to 2015: Felpham Community College (Felpham, UK)
  - My A-levels were Mathematics (A), Further Mathematics (B), Physics (B), AS Spanish (B) and STEP Mathematics (Level 3).

### Certifications

- September 2020: Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate
- May 2020: Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals

### Skills

- As well as being fluent in Python, R and SQL for data analysis, I develop personal open-source projects in the languages Julia and Typescript as a hobby.
  For example, I created `DataSkimmer.jl`, a Julia package to quickly summarise tabular data in the terminal.
  All of my personal projects can be found on my website ([`ha.nnes.dev`](https://ha.nnes.dev/)).
- Languages: English (native), Afrikaans (fluent), Spanish (intermediate) and Mandarin (beginner).
