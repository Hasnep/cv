Experienced data engineer with a background in statistics and mathematics.

### Employment

- October 2021 to Present: Data Engineer, Sainsbury's (London, UK)
  - Worked in the logistics and freight management team maintaining and developing large ELT pipelines for structured and semi-structured data from many data sources. (AWS S3, Airflow, Snowflake)
  - Designed, proposed and built a robust application to automate managing AWS database migration service tasks. (Python, AWS ADK)
  - Worked to overhaul CI pipelines for projects where mistakes were being consistently made. (GitHub Actions, Circle CI)
- July 2019 to October 2021: Strategic Consultant (Data Engineering), Amey Strategic Consulting (London, UK)
  - Lead data engineer of a GIS (Geographic Information System) dashboard creating insights into operations and tracking KPIs for a local county council. (AWS, Kubernetes, Airflow)
    - Created ETL pipelines to load data from IoT devices, online APIs and daily reports into a central database. (Python, Airflow, Postgres)
    - Maintained the production platform by monitoring alerts, quickly fixing bugs and pre-emptively hardening code by implementing CI checks. (Azure Pipelines)
    - Built visualisations which gave the client new interactive insights about their work and automated previously laborious processes. (React.js, Plotly.js, Flask)
    - Designed and built a proof-of-concept application to manage and collect data from a network of custom IoT sensors to monitor infrastructure assets in real-time.
    - Identified an inefficiency in the client's work allocation and developed a predictive machine learning model to enable data-driven planning. (FB Prophet)
  - Collaborated with the HR department to analyse the gender pay gap of thousands of employees across all departments in the company.
    - The visualisations, statistics and forecasts I produced using R guided the company when choosing to become a living-wage employer.
    - Developed a Python package to automatically perform these forecasts and trained an HR analyst with no prior Python knowledge to use the package to produce new data reports.
  - Completed a focused two-week analytics sprint evaluating the output of a contract Amey has with a local council.
    - Collected user-stories and datasets from the client's team to understand their processes and goals.
    - Delivered an engaging presentation with insightful data visualisations highlighting key successes and opportunities for improvement.
  - Joined a team during "crunch-time" to successfully complete delivery of an interactive computer-vision dashboard to review dashcam footage, removing the need for a human co-driver. (Azure ML SDK)
- June 2018 to September 2018: Data Science Services Intern, Asia Analytics Taiwan (Taipei, Taiwan)
  - Created extensions for data cleansing and data mining in SPSS and SPSS Modeller using Python and R.
  - Wrote an in-depth tutorial on programming using SPSS Syntax from scratch, allowing new users to understand the important features of the language quickly and start analysing data.

### Education

- 2015 to 2019: MMath Mathematics, 2:1 (University of Exeter, UK)
  - My Masters' dissertation involved combining modern neural networks using Keras with more traditional regression and Gaussian processes models with the aim of providing more human-understandable insights to machine learning algorithms.
    I successfully modelled a neural network using multiple techniques in a way that simplified the complex internal system to well-understood statistical processes.
  - Other modules included statistical modelling using R, machine learning using Python and spatio-temporal statistics.

### Certifications

- September 2020: Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate
- May 2020: Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals

### Skills

- As well as being fluent in Python, SQL and Typescript, I develop open-source projects in Julia and Rust as a hobby.
  My portfolio of personal projects can be found on my website ([`ha.nnes.dev`](https://ha.nnes.dev/)).
- Languages: English (native), Afrikaans (fluent), Spanish (intermediate) and Mandarin (beginner).
