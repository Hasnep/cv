# My CV

My super simple CV written in markdown.

## Building

Building with the `Makefile` requires [`GNU Make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) and [`tectonic`](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/).
Just run `make build` to build the document to both PDF and HTML.
